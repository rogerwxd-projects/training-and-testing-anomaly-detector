## Training and Testing Anomaly Detector


This project will include various examples of using machine learning for anomaly detection (network attacks) in different scenarios and datasets extracted using the tool: [PacketTraitAnalyzer](https://github.com/rogerwxd-projects/PacketTraitAnalyzer)

Tests:
